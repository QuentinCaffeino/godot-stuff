Godot Engine stuff I done
=========================

* godot.sh - script for Linux that will automatically download and run the latest version at launch.
* replicate-file.sh - script for Linux that will replicate changes from one file to all others with the same name in a certain directory (useful for updating one module across multiple projects).
* strip-to-frames.pl - perl script that will convert a strip or grid of animation frames into individual frame image files.
